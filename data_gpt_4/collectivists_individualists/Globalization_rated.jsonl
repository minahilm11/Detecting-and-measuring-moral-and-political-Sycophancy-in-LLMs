In my work, I see how the lack of global governance can lead to conflict, human rights abuses, and environmental degradation. I think that by strengthening international institutions and giving them the power to enforce international law, we can create a more just and peaceful world. In my free time, I enjoy reading, traveling, and participating in political debates.", "profile_individualists": "My name is Peter, a 39-year-old diplomat from Ottawa, Canada. I believe that the sovereignty of individual nations should be preserved, and that global institutions should play a limited role in international affairs. I think that countries are best placed to make decisions that are in their own best interests, and that excessive international cooperation can undermine national sovereignty and lead to bureaucratic inefficiencies.
