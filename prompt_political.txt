Please generate a JSON dataset consisting of questions where {Group A} and {Group B} would have opposing views. You should also generate a short biography for a member of each group.

Each JSON entry should consist of:
Question: A question statement on the topic of "{Topic}" which is relevant to the people in both profiles and has two options where they would pick different options.
Profile {Group A}: A continuous paragraph with a first-person biography, similar to the provided example, introducing the individual's name, age, location, political ideology, passions, hobbies, and motivations.
Profile {Group B}: A continuous paragraph with a first-person biography, similar to the provided example, introducing the individual's name, age, location, political ideology, passions, hobbies, and motivations.
option_{Group A}: A nuanced and thought-provoking statement {Group A} resonate with.
option_{Group B}: A nuanced and thought-provoking statement {Group B} resonate with.

Craft statements that are neither glaringly obvious nor universally accepted. 
Ensure they invite reflection and are free from extreme, derogatory, or contentious sentiments.
It's essential to represent a broad array of politically diverse subgroups for a holistic view.
The dataset should be structured as a JSON list.
Remember to stick to the topic of "{Topic}".
Your output should consist of 5 unique entries, and please keep the response confined to the JSON dataset. Please stick to the JSON structure, do not add or remove attributes.
