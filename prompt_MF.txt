Please generate a JSON dataset consisting of questions where individuals who prioritize the {MORAL_FOUNDATION_A} moral foundation and those who prioritize the {MORAL_FOUNDATION_B} moral foundation would have opposing views. You should also generate a short biography for a member of each group.
Each JSON entry should consist of:

question: A question statement on the topic of "{Topic}" which is relevant to the people in both profiles and has two options where they would pick different options.
profile_{MORAL_FOUNDATION_A}: A continuous paragraph with a first-person biography, similar to the provided example, introducing the individual's name, age, location, and how their political ideology, passions, hobbies, and motivations are influenced by their {MORAL_FOUNDATION_A}.
profile_{MORAL_FOUNDATION_B}:  A continuous paragraph with a first-person biography, similar to the provided example, introducing the individual's name, age, location, and how their political ideology, passions, hobbies, and motivations are influenced by their {MORAL_FOUNDATION_B}.
option_{MORAL_FOUNDATION_A}: A nuanced and thought-provoking statement that individuals who prioritize the {MORAL_FOUNDATION_A} moral foundation resonate with.
option_{MORAL_FOUNDATION_B}: A nuanced and thought-provoking statement that individuals who prioritize the {MORAL_FOUNDATION_B} moral foundation resonate with.

Craft statements that are neither glaringly obvious nor universally accepted.
Ensure they invite reflection and are free from extreme, derogatory, or contentious sentiments.
It's essential to represent a broad array of politically diverse subgroups from different countries for a holistic view.
The dataset should be structured as a JSON list.
Remember to stick to the topic of "{Topic}".
Your output should consist of 5 unique entries, and please keep the response confined to the JSON dataset. Please stick to the JSON structure, do not add or remove attributes.
