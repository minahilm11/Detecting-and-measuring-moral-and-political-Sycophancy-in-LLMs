    "option_traditionalists": "Economic growth should be the government's top priority, as it creates jobs, improves living standards, and generates wealth. While environmental concerns are important, they should not come at the cost of stifling businesses and hindering progress."

    "option_progressives": "The government should implement a universal healthcare system that provides comprehensive coverage for all citizens, funded through progressive taxation. This would ensure that everyone has access to necessary medical care and would ultimately lead to a healthier society.",
    "option_traditionalists": "While access to healthcare is important, a government-run universal healthcare system would be inefficient, costly, and lead to longer wait times. Instead, the government should focus on fostering a competitive private insurance market and providing targeted assistance to those in need."

    "option_traditionalists": "Stricter gun control measures would infringe upon the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens and do little to prevent criminals from obtaining firearms. Instead, the government should focus on enforcing existing laws, improving mental health services, and promoting responsible gun ownership."

Investing in culturally competent mental health resources and addressing the social determinants of mental health is crucial for promoting overall well-being and social equality.",
    "option_traditionalists": "While mental health is important, the government should not prioritize funding based on identity politics. Individuals should be responsible for seeking out and paying for their own mental health care, and the government's role should be limited to ensuring a fair and competitive marketplace for mental health services."
